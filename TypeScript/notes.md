What is TypeScript?
- TypeScript is a JavaScript superset ––– it's a language that builds up on JavaScript that adds new features and advantages
- Browser and node.js doesn't execute TypeScript, therefore it complies to JavaScript
- Forces us write better, cleaner, and less error code
- TypeScript helps us during development by adding an extra step
- JavaScript uses `dynamic types` (resolves at runtime), while TypeScript uses `static types` (set during development)

Notes: 
- Adding an `! as []` means that it will not yield null
- Added a `:` implies that you are defining the variable type causing us to be very explicit about the types
- Core Types: 
  - number –– 1, 5.3, 10 
  - string –– '', "", ``
  - boolean –– true/false
