I'm currently in the process of learning Gatsby, so here are my notes on it:

1. Gatsby is used strictly for static pages
2. Pages in Gatsby (index.js â†’ homepage) is served as the endpoint, it's where Gatsby will look at.
3. To link pages together, you can either use an <a> tag or a <Link> imported from gatsby itself
4. To use sass with Gatsby, you must install it `gatsby-plugin-sass` and then add it to the plugins in the gatsby-config file
5. It's best to create a layout if most of your pages involve the same component (footer, header, and etc.)
